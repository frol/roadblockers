# roadblockers

It is my personal list of roadblocking issues. It turns out there are too many
of them to keep them in mind, so I need a place to track them.

# Swift

* Static executable compilation is broken on Linux: https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-10328

# AirPods on Linux

* HFP not working with PulseAudio (there is a workaround with ofono + phonesim): https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_headset#HFP_not_working_with_PulseAudio
