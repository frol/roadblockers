# roadblockers

It is my personal list of roadblocking issues. It turns out there are too many
of them to keep them in mind, so I need a place to track them.

## Conda (Anaconda)

## Linux Kernel

* [REGRESSION] Intensive Memory CGroup removal leads to high load average 10+ https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=190841

## Linux Desktop

* Gnome 3 Stuttering / lagging desktop animations after suspend (X11 and Wayland) https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=764253
* Gnome 3 on Wayland has hard-coded 60Hz monitor refresh rate (my laptop monitor supports only 48Hz) https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781296

## Swagger
