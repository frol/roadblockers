# roadblockers

It is my personal list of roadblocking issues. It turns out there are too many
of them to keep them in mind, so I need a place to track them.

## Linux Desktop

* Gnome 3 Stuttering / lagging desktop animations after suspend (X11 and Wayland) https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=764253
* Gnome 3 on Wayland has hard-coded 60Hz monitor refresh rate (my laptop monitor supports only 48Hz) https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=781296

## Swagger

* OAuth2 Password Flow modes do not match RFC https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/3227
* \[JavaScript\] Missing comma between parameters in documentation https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/6920

## Rancher

* Memory usage is misleading https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/10302
